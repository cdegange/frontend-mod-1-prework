## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
  Learning from errors in code and treating it as opportunity, not failure.
  Asking for help or looking for resources when they are needed.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I need to be more positive when code doesn't work instead of beating myself up.
I want to look for solutions myself before asking for help as I progress through the program.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

Strava. The app needs to store activities for users as they are uploaded, records and created routes.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

and Array method is code that modifies an Array through addition, subtraction or both

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
The purpose of a loop is to eliminate repetitive code that uses the same process. Rather than going item by item in an array
we an use a loop to do the process for us.

Loops can be used in conjunction with Arrays to evaluate a group of items without writing repetitive code.
Loops can also be used with if else statements and comparison operators to evaluate groups of data.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

Its like stacking legos in a pattern where the order is the same over and over.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops? Can we use other variables in for loops or is the i pretty standard?
