## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it? I think what resonated most with me from the article was that superlearners are always learning. I want to start reading more and practicing code on a daily basis.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each. Numbers (any positive, negative, integer or decimals), strings (words!) and Booleans (true or false statements).

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console? console.log('Hello World!')

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment? // Pseudocode or code you aren't ready to run yet.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old? Assignment of a value for later use. Putting a your key to the house in a safe place so you never lose it.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold? ESPN, Score (number), Team (String), Time remaining (number).

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is. Combining  Words, phrases and variables into a single string

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention? Anywhere a template could be used repeatedly

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option) Did I need to commit each exercise to git as I progressed through section 1? It seemed that was the only way to check code at the end of each exercise.
