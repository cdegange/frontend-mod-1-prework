## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique? I didn't follow the Pomodoro technique. I have my own system that I feel works well.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)? Time estimations were fairly accurate and I was able to focus well.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript? Arrays are ordered lists that items are accessible by index. Objects are mutatable key-value pairs.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
  Array- Single key (name)
  * List of states and their capitals
  Object- Works well with Class and Key-Value
  * List of things to pack for vacation
  Array- ordered list
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
  Array- Ordered list.
  * List of student names and their cohort
  Object- Class and Key-Value pairs
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
  object- multiple key value pairs
  * All my favorite restaurants
  Array- Ordered list

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values? Strava, Activity Type. Run, Bike, Swim

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects? Would like more information and examples on Object methods
