## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between? I feel I have the habit of asking too soon sometimes because I want to continue moving forward.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning? I actually felt pretty good about it. I had a few minor hiccups in section 1 that already had me thinking and looking for solutions on my own.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use. A conditional statement is a comparison of 2 values. Caffeine content of coffee vs tea.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do. We use if else statements to evaluate multiple conditions. Essentially the program reads through the conditionals until it evaluates one to be true and then executes the 'then' portion.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code? the logical operators && and ||

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions? can an if else statement end with if else or does it need to be else?
